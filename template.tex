\section{Methods}

\replaced[id=MKH]{
The exergy of a system is the maximum amount of work
that can be extracted
by processes that take the system
to equilibrium with the reference environment,
defined by $T_{0}$, $P_{0}$, and a certain chemical composition.
}

\replaced[id=MKH]{
Thus, the total exergy of a system
is the sum of the work of two reversible processes
that bring the system
(a) from $T$ and $P$ to
$T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$
(without changes in the chemical composition) and
(b) from its chemical composition to
to the reference chemical composition
(while the system remains at $T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$).
}

Thanatia is the reference environment used for material exergy.
Reference environments can include the Atmosphere,
the Ocean, or the Earth's crust.
For our purposes,
the reference environments are at $T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$,
and are characterized by a mixture of reference species.

Reference species are charcterized by partial pressure
($P_{i} = P_{0} y_{i}$) in the Atmosphere,
by concentrations ($[C]_{i}$) in the Ocean
and by mole fraction ($y_{i}$)
in the Earth's crust.

The exergy in the total process ($B_mix$) is the ambient temperature ($T_{0}$) multiplied by the change
in entropy of the mixture from Thanatia to the current state ($S_{mix}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_exergy_of_mixture_definition1}
  B_{mix} = T_{0}S_{mix} = -RT_{0}\sum_{i}{N_{i}{y_{i}}\ln{y_{i}}}
\end{equation}

The total exergy of a mixture ($B_{mix}$) is the exergy per mole ($b_{mix}$)
multiplied by the number of moles
in the mixture ($N_{mix}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_exergy_of_mixture_definition2}
  B_{mix} = \frac{b_{mix}}{N_{mix}} = -RT_{0}\sum_{i}y_{i}\ln{y_{i}}
\end{equation}

The material exergy ($B$) of a natural resource
has two components:
(1) the amount of work that must be done
to separate, in a reversible process, the mixture
at $T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$, and
(2) the sum of the amounts of work
that can be obtained by the reversible processes
that take each pure compound at $T_{0}$, $P_{0}$
to the equilibrium concentration in the Crepuscular Crust.

The material exergy ($B$) is the sum of the chemical ($b_{ch}$) and distribution ($b_d$) exergies
when individually multiplied
by the number of moles ($n_i$)
for each compound in the mixture.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_exergy_definition}
  B_{1} = \sum_{i}{n_{i,1}b_{ch,i,1}} + \sum_{i}{n_{i,1}b_{d,i,1}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:simplified_material_exergy_definition}
  b_{i,1} = b_{ch,i,1} + b_{d,i,1}
\end{equation}

% How are we defining the compound compared to the component number?

The first component of molar intensive material exergy, $b_{1}$,
is the sum of chemical exergies of each compound
present in the mixture, $b_{ch,i,1}$,
and the second is the sum of distribution exergies of each compound
present in the mixutre, $b_{d,i,1}$
The total exergy per mole ($b$) is equal to the sum of the chemical exergies ($b_{ch}$)
and the distribution exergies ($b_{d,i}$) for each compound.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_molar_intensive_exergy_definition}
  b_{1} = \sum_{i}{b_{ch,i,1}} + \sum_{i}{b_{d,i,1}}
\end{equation}

Chemical ($b_{ch,i}$) and distribution ($b_{d,i}$) exergies are broken down
by the element in a compound
for a mixture.

Natural resources have a positive material exergy, ($b$),
because they have a chemical composition
that differentiates them from the Environment.
Material exergy of a natural resource, ($b_{i}$),
is the work that would be needed
to produce that substance with its structure,
known as chemical exergy ($b_{ch,i}$),
and the distribution in a reversible process ($b_{d,i}$),
with respect to the reference environment.
A natural resource is a mixture of compounds.
If it is a mixture of gases,
it is assumed to behave as an ideal mixture of gases.
If it is a mixture of solid or liquid components,
it is assumed to behave as an ideal solution.

The chemical exergy of each compound, ($b_{ch,i}$), is dependent
on whether it exists or not
in the reference environment.
If compound ($i$) does not exist
in the reference environment,
chemical exergy is the amount of work obtained
in the reversible chemical reactions
that decomposes the pure compound at ambient temperature, ($T_{0}$)
into reference species ($i$) that are in equilibrium
with the environment.

The chemical exergy, ($b_{ch}$), is the Gibbs energy, ($G$), for the compound
plus the sum of chemical exergy, ($b_{ch}$),
multiplied by the number of moles
in the mix ($n-{j,i}$) for each element, $j$,
in the compound observed, $i$.

The amount of work obtained
in a reversible process is the Gibbs energy
of formation for that process.
This is the difference between the Gibbs energies
of the input species and output species.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_chemical_exergy_definition}
  b_{ch,i} = \Delta{G_{f,i}} + \sum_{j}{n_{j,i}b_{ch,j}}
\end{equation}

The chemical exergy per mole ($b_{ch}$) is the molar fraction ($y$)
of a species multiplied by the chemical exergy of that same species ($b_{ch}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:chemical_exergy_state_point1}
  b_{ch,i,1} = y_{i,1}b_{ch,i}
\end{equation}

A concentration of a species
may change between statepoints.
The number of moles of a species in each mixture ($n_{i,mix}$)
determines the distribution of the species
compared to the rest of the mixture.
The original statepoint of distribution exergy ($b_d$) is the amount of moles per moles
in the Earth's crust, also known as Thanatia.

The distribution exergy for a species, ($b_d,i$),
either at the current state or Thanatia
equation uses the universal gas constant, ($R$),
ambient temperature, ($T_0$),
and molar fraction of a species, ($y_i$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_distribution_exergy_of_current_statepoint_definition}
  b_{d,i} = -RT_{0}y_{i}\ln{y_{i}}
\end{equation}

The total distribution of a species ($b_{d,i}$) is the change in distribution exergy from Thanatia ($b_{d,i,0}$)
to the species current state ($b_{d,i,1}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_distribution_exergy_from_reference_statepoint_to_thanatia}
  b_{d,i} = b_{d,i,1} - b_{d,i,0}
\end{equation}

Substituting Equation~(\ref{eq:specific_distribution_exergy_of_current_statepoint_definition}) into Equation~(\ref{eq:specific_distribution_exergy_from_reference_statepoint_to_thanatia}),
the following equation is found

\begin{equation} \label{eq:specific_distribution_exergy_from_statepoint_to_thanatia_definition}
  b_{d,i} = -RT_{0}(y_{i,1}\ln{y_{i,1}} - y_{i,0}\ln{y_{i,0}}) \ .
\end{equation}

% begin Move the following paragraphs
When considering the mineral composition
of the Earth's crust,
a reference environment of Thanatia
or the Crepuscular Crust model is used.
In this model, the 294 most abundant mineral species
that make up the Earth's crust
are considered to be uniformly dispersed
and have even concentration throughout any portion
of the upper continental crust.

According the Crepuscular Crust model,
natural resources have a positive material exergy
because they have a chemical composition that
differs from the composition they would have when
completely dispersed.
% End Move out paragraphs


Henceforth, the natural resource is assumed to be a mixture
of liquids or solids
and to behave as an ideal solution.

Material exergy per mole ($b$) requires chemical ($b_{ch}$) and distribution ($b_d$) exergies per mole
for each species in a mixture.


****

We have a nomenclature problem here.
We have $b_{total} = b_{th} + b_{ch}$.
Then we have
$b_{ch}$ being inside the $b_{i,1}$ equation below.

****

Also, we should define $i$ and $j$ subscripts in the text.

Finally, I think we should have a diagram associated with this description.
Maybe something like Figure 1 from Valero 2011.

% Potentially start with the entropy equation or remove following lines
The entropy of a mixture ($S$) is the negative gas constant ($R$)
and number of mole of the mix ($N$)
multiplied by the sum of the molar fraction
and log of the fraction of moles per species ($y_i$$lny_i$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_entropy_of_mixture_definition}
  S_{mix} = -RN_{mix}(y_{1}\ln{y_{1}} + y_{2}\ln{y_{2}} + y_{3}\ln{y_{3}} + \ldots)

%\begin{equation}\label{eq:general_material_exergy_definition}
%  \replaced[id=MKH]{b_{total} = b_{th} + b_{ch}}

\replaced[id=MKH]{
Here, we assume that the system is at
$T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$;
thus, thermomechanical exergy ($b_{th}$) is zero.
Doing so enables focus on the chemical exergy

%Description of Combustion Example
The combustion of methane is considered a simple chemical process
with one outlet and two inlet streams.
For the example shown above in Figure~\ref{fig:combustion_process},
the reactants entering the combustion chamber are methane (CH$_4$) and air.
To further simplify this process,
we considered an atmospheric reference environment
including only oxygen (O$_2$).
Including additional species
(such as N$_2$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O) would be a better representation
of earth's atmosphere,
but would result in more complicated analysis.
Further analysis with a different atmospheric model
can be carried out following the same methods shown here.

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/combustion1}
%\end{adjustwidth}
\caption{Simplified methane combustion process with inlet and outlet streams.}
\label{fig:combustion_process}
\end{figure}

To begin the material exergy analysis for a sample,
the process's related chemical equation must be balanced.
For the situation presented here,
there are two moles of diatomic oxygen per mole of methane.
This leads to the products of combustion as
one mole of carbon dioxide and two moles of water vapor. %insert chemical equation figure

Using elemental molar masses of 12.011~g/mol for carbon,
1.00794~g/mol for hydrogen,
and 15.9994~g/mol for oxygen,
the masses of components in the process streams
can be determined from an initial amount of any of them.
Further, if the influent methane sample is assumed
to be of 1000~kg,
the other species have masses of 3989.2068~kg for O$_2$ ,
2743.3067~kg for CO$_2$ ,
and 2245.9170~kg for H$_2$O.
