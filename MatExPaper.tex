\subsection{Material Exergy Calculation}
\label{ssec: material exergy calculation}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The exergy of a system ($B$) is the maximum amount of work
that can be extracted
by processes that take the system
to equilibrium with the reference environment,
defined by $T_{0}$, $P_{0}$, and a certain chemical composition.\\

Thus, the total exergy of a system ($B$)
is the sum of the work of two reversible processes
that bring the system
(a) from $T$ and $P$ to
$T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$
(without changes in the chemical composition) and
(b) from its chemical composition to
to the reference chemical composition
(while the system remains at $T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$).


Reference environments can include the Atmosphere,
the Ocean, or the Earth's crust.
For our purposes,
the reference environments are at $T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$,
and are characterized by a mixture of reference species.

Reference species are charcterized by partial pressure
($P_{i} = P_{0} y_{i}$) in the Atmosphere,
by concentrations ($C_{i}$) in the Ocean
and by mole fraction ($y_{i}$)
in the Earth's crust.


Natural resources have a positive material exergy ($b$)
because they have a chemical composition
that differentiates them from the Environment.
Material exergy of a natural resource ($b_{i}$)
is the work that would be needed
to produce that substance with its structure,
known as chemical exergy ($b_{ch,i}$),
and the concentration in a reversible process ($b_{c,i}$),
with respect to the reference environment.
A natural resource is a mixture of compounds ($i$).
If it is a mixture of gases,
it is assumed to behave as an ideal mixture of gases.
If it is a mixture of solid or liquid components,
it is assumed to behave as an ideal solution.

The exergy in the total process ($B_{mix}$) is the ambient temperature ($T_{0}$) multiplied by the change
in entropy of the mixture from the Earth's crust to the current state ($S_{mix}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_exergy_of_mixture_definition1}
  B_{mix} = T_{0}S_{mix} = -RT_{0}\sum_{i}{N_{i}{y_{i}}\ln{y_{i}}}
\end{equation}

The entropy of a mixture ($S$) is the negative gas constant ($R$)
and number of mole of the mix ($N$)
multiplied by the sum of the molar fraction
and log of the fraction of moles per species ($y_i$$lny_i$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_entropy_of_mixture_definition}
  S_{mix} = -RN_{mix}(y_{1}\ln{y_{1}} + y_{2}\ln{y_{2}} + y_{3}\ln{y_{3}} + \ldots)
          = -RN_{mix}\sum_{i} y_{i}\ln{y_{i}}
\end{equation}


The total exergy of a mixture ($B_{mix}$) is the exergy per mole ($b_{mix}$)
multiplied by the number of moles
in the mixture ($N_{mix}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_exergy_of_mixture_definition2}
  B_{mix} = {b_{mix}}{N_{mix}} = -RT_{0}\sum_{i}y_{i}\ln{y_{i}}
\end{equation}

Material exergy ($b$) is broken down into three components.
The first term is thermomechanical exergy ($b_{th}$).
The second term is chemical exergy ($b_{ch}$).
The third term is concentration exergy ($b_{c}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:general_material_exergy_definition}
 b_{total} = b_{th} + b_{ch} + b_{c}
\end{equation}

Here, we assume that the system is at
$T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$;
thus, thermomechanical exergy ($b_{th}$) is zero.
Doing so enables focus on the chemical and concentration exergy
($b_{ch}$ and $b_{c}$, also called material exergy).

The first component of molar intensive material exergy, $b_{1}$,
is the sum of chemical exergies of each compound
present in the mixture, $b_{ch,i,1}$.
% We calculate chemical exergy values ($b_{ch}$)
% from Table 9.1 in Valero and Valero. ~\cite{Valero 2015}
The second is the sum of concentration exergies of each compound
present in the mixutre, $b_{c,i,1}$.
The total exergy per mole ($b$) is equal to the sum of the chemical exergies ($b_{ch}$)
and the concentration exergies ($b_{c,i}$) for each compound.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_molar_intensive_exergy_definition}
  b_{i,1} = \sum_{i}{b_{ch,i,1}} + \sum_{i}{b_{c,i,1}}
\end{equation}


% How are we defining the compound compared to the component number?

Chemical ($b_{ch,i}$) and concentration ($b_{c,i}$) exergies are broken down
by the element ($j$) in a compound ($i$)
for a mixture.

The chemical exergy of each compound ($b_{ch,i}$) is dependent
on whether it exists or not
in the reference environment.
If compound ($i$) does not exist
in the reference environment,
chemical exergy is the amount of work obtained
in the reversible chemical reactions
that decomposes the pure compound at ambient temperature ($T_{0}$)
into reference species ($i$) that are in equilibrium
with the environment.

The chemical exergy ($b_{ch}$) is the Gibbs energy ($\delta{G}$)
plus the sum of chemical exergy ($b_{ch}$)
multiplied by the number of moles
in the mix ($n_{j,i}$) for each element ($j$)
in the compound observed ($i$).

The amount of work obtained
in a reversible process is the Gibbs energy
of formation for that process.
This is the difference between the Gibbs energies
of the input species and output species.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_chemical_exergy_definition}
  b_{ch,i} = \Delta{G_{f,i}} + \sum_{i}{n_{j,i}b_{ch,j}}
\end{equation}

The chemical exergy per mole ($b_{ch}$) is the molar fraction ($y$)
of a species multiplied by the chemical exergy of that same species ($b_{ch}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:chemical_exergy_state_point1}
  b_{ch,i} = y_{i}b_{ch,i}
\end{equation}

The concentration of a species
may change between statepoints.
The number of moles of a species in each mixture ($n_{i,mix}$)
determines the concentration of the species
compared to the rest of the mixture.
The original statepoint of concentration exergy ($b_{c,0}$) is the pure substance
of an element ($j$) or compound ($i$).

The concentration exergy for a species ($b_c,i$)
at the current state
equation uses the universal gas constant ($R$),
ambient temperature ($T_0$),
and molar fraction of a species, ($y_i$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_concentration_exergy_of_current_statepoint_definition}
  b_{c,i} = -RT_{0}(\ln(y_{i}) - \ln(y_{i,0})
\end{equation}

The pure substance molar fraction ($y_{i,0}$) is always equal to one.
Equation equation~\ref{eq:specific_concentration_exergy_of_current_statepoint_definition} becomes

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_concentration_exergy_of_current_statepoint_definition}
  b_{c,i} = -RT_{0}(\ln(y_{i}).
\end{equation}


The material exergy at some statepoint, for example, the first statepoint, ($B_{1}$)
is the sum of the chemical ($b_{ch,1}$) and concentration ($b_c,1$) exergies
when individually multiplied
by the number of moles ($n_{i,1}$)
for each compound ($i$) in the mixture.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_exergy_of_current_statepoint_definition}
  B_{i,1} = \sum_{i}{n_{i,1}b_{ch,i,1}} + \sum_{i}{n_{i,1}b_{c,i,1}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:simplified_material_exergy_of_current_statepoint_definition}
  b_{i,1} = b_{ch,i,1} + b_{c,i,1}
\end{equation}

The exergy contribution of a compound ($b_i$) is dependent
on its molar fraction
and the total number of moles
in a mixture.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_exergy_of_current_statepoint_molar_based_definition}
  B_{i,1} = y_{i,1}b_{i,1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:specific_exergy_of_current_statepoint_mixture_definition}
  B_{mix,i,1} = N_{mix,1}b_{i,1}
\end{equation}

The total exergy at a statepoint
is the sum of the component's exergy.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:total_exergy_of_current_statepoint_mixture_definition}
  B_{mix,1} = \sum{B_{mix,i,1}}
\end{equation}

The material exergy at each statepoint ($B_{mix}$) is calculated as shown.
The results allow for further calculations
of process efficiencies.

\subsection{Energy Exergy Calculation}
\label{ssec: energy exergy calculation}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A material conversion chain
is made of both material and energy inputs.
To change a mixture's composition,
energy is used
to concentrate certain components
and remove unnecessary components.

The total energy exergy ($X$)
of a process
is determined by the type of energy utilized.
A constant, denoted by ($\phi$),
is multiplied by the energy input
to calculate the exergy.
The phi constant depends on the type of energy used.
For example, natural gas has a phi constant of 1.04
while coking coal has a constant of 1.05.
Further information about the phi constants used
may be found in Appendix [X].

\begin{equation}\label{eq:energy_exergy_definition}
  X_{i} = \phi E_{i}
\end{equation}

The sum of energy exergy inputs is the total energy exergy
included in a process.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:total_energy_exergy_definition}
  X = \sum{\phi E_{i}}
\end{equation}




%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Efficiency Methods}
\label{ssec: efficiency_methods_and_calculations}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Efficiencies for a process may be calculated
in various ways.
Each efficiency calculation provides specific information
about a process.
The following three efficiency calculation methods apply
in the context of a material conversion chain:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Bejan method focuses on the main product
  at a statepoint
  to quantify how the material's concentration exergy upgraded
  due to energy inputs.
  See figure Figure~\ref{fig: efficiencymethods}\\

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Bejan Efficiency}
  \eta_{x} = \frac{N_i(b_{m,i,1} - b_{m,i,0})}{\sum{X_{in}}}
  \end{equation}

  In the case of the blast furnace,
  the Bejan method uses the material exergy ($b_{m,i}$)
  of hematite ore
  and compares it to the material exergy
  at the next statepoint.
  The energy exergy input, to the blast furnace,
  is the work it takes to concentrate the hematite ore
  to pig iron.
  The Bejan method is helpful
  for calculating the efficiency
  of concentrating a specific element or compound.

  \item The Product method focuses on the main product's exergy output
  compared to the total exergy input.
  See figure Figure~\ref{fig: efficiencymethods}\\

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Product Efficiency}
  \eta_{x} = \frac{(B_{m,i,1})}{\sum{X_{in}}+\sum{B_{in}}}
  \end{equation}

  The Product method uses the total material exergy ($B$) of the desired output,
  such as pig iron,
  and the total material exergy
  of all material and energy streams
  as the input.

  The Product method is helpful
  for calculating the efficiency
  for creating a specific mixture separated
  from waste streams.\\

  \item The Student method focuses on the total exergy output
  compared to the total exergy input.
  See figure Figure~\ref{fig: efficiencymethods}\\

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:Student Efficiency}
  \eta_{x} = \frac{\sum{B_{out}}}{\sum{X_{in}} + \sum{B_{in}}}
  \end{equation}

  The Student method is helpful
  for quick efficiency calculations
  of an overall process.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data}
\label{ssec: data}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The material conversioin chain is a partial example chain
of a potential South African pig iron production process.
Energy inputs information
for extraction, hauling, and beneficiation processes
is from the Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Mining Industry.

Mass amounts and composition
for each statepoint
comes from various sources.
The ore and coal compositions closely represent potential versions
of a South African pig iron production process.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we present results
for the material exergy
of inputs to the blast furnace,
the PSUT matrices for exergy accounting,
and selected process efficiencies.

An entire exergy accounting,
additional matrices,
and efficiencies
for the material conversion chain
can be found in Appendix [X].

\subsection{Material Exergies}
\label{ssec: blast furnace example}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A material conversion chain
of pig iron production
contains [X] material statepoints,
[X] energy statepoints,
and [X] processes.
Example tables for the statepoints exergies
can be found in Appendix [X].\\

Equations [X] to [X] are the basis for material exergy accounting
along the material conversion chain.
Table [X] shows the solid inputs
to the blast furnace: iron ore, limestone, and coking coal.
Table [X] shows the air input
to the blast furnace.


The chemical and concentration exergy,
columns [X] and [X],
sum to the total material exergy
based on the molar amount
of each component
based on Eqn. [X].
Column [X] is the total material exergy
for each component
calculated by Eqn. [X].
The sum of exergy inputs ($B_{m,i}$)
is the total material exergy
of the mixture.

Three efficiency calculation methods,
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:efficiencymethods},
were applied to processing steps
in the material conversion chain.

\end{table}

The efficiencies of iron ore processes,
in Table~\ref{fig:Process Efficiencies for iron, limestone, and coal ore.},
are lower than the limestone and coal efficiencies.

The iron ore extraction Students efficiency is **54**$\%$
and the Product efficiency is **45**$\%$.
The limestone and coal extraction efficiencies range
from **78** to **99**$\%$.
Refer to Table~\ref{fig:Process Efficiencies for iron, limestone, and coal ore.}
to see similar results
for hauling efficiencies.\\
The mixer and blast furnace efficiencies
are equal because the desired output is the same.
The Bejan efficiency
for the blast furnace
is **8**$\%$.
The Students efficiency is **45**$\%$
and the Product efficiency is **42**$\%$.
