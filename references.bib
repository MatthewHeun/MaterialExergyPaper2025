	abstract = {There have been five foremost empirical efforts regarding energy return on investment (EROI) analysis over the past few years, including the topics of: (1) whether corn ethanol is a net energy yielder; (2) a summary of the state of EROI for most major fuel types; (3) alternative applications of EROI, such as energy return on water invested (EROWI); (4) the relation between EROI and the economy; and (5) an attempt to calculate the minimum EROI for a sustainable society. This paper offers a review of these five main areas of interest and provides a history of the development of EROI as well as a review of some of the various definitions of EROI and how they apply to EROI analyses. The paper concludes by listing numerous areas of improvement that are needed within EROI research.},

@article{Plank:2022aa,
	abstract = {Global material stocks of infrastructure, buildings, machinery and consumer products are growing rapidly, driving emissions and other environmental impacts during materials extraction, processing, construction and waste. However, international data on economy-wide material flows (ew-MFA) currently is limited to national extraction, trade and consumption and does not integrate material processing. Further developments for ew-MFA are required, ranging from more transparent data compilation and uncertainty assessments and improved representation of socio-economic material cycles to large spatio-temporal coverage. We herein present a novel ew-MFA database covering 14 major stock-building materials in 177 countries for the period 1900-2016. Included materials are, i.a., concrete, asphalt, bricks, timber, steel, aluminum, copper, other metals, plastics and glass. We developed a high-quality dataset by combining material flow accounting and analysis principles into a consistent 10-step compilation procedure, including the differentiation of processing stages from extraction to construction, as well as systematic uncertainty assessments. We find that global primary gross-additions-to-stock (GASprim) grew exponentially over almost the entire time period, largely in unison with GDP. In the year 2016, 39.7 $\pm$6.1 Gt/year of raw materials were extracted, of which 23% turned into waste during processing, resulting in 30.7 $\pm$5.7 Gt/year of GASprim. From the 1990s onwards, China outpaced all other countries in terms of annual per-capita GASprim and has dominated global dynamics since then. Across all countries, we find that per-capita GASprim and GDP decoupled over time. However, we find no indications for novel economic development pathways which are substantially less material-intensive in terms of stock-building than in the past.},

@inbook{Ting_2022,
	abstract = {This chapter explains what thermodynamics is. It illustrates the conservation of energy using everyday examples, clearly revealing the transformation of energy from one form to another. The quality of energy is demonstrated alongside with the transformation of energy, that is, energy naturally transforms progressively to lower quality form. Also delineated are the three fundamental types of thermodynamic systems. The chapter concludes with thermodynamic state, equilibrium, and properties.},
