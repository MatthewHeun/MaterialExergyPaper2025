- [ ] MKH: get the paper to build
- [ ] clean up data repo
- [ ] Potential b_c example (large amount of b)
      (relevance of concentration exergy)
- [ ] b_c vs. N graph (need to decide if we want to include a graph like this)
- [ ] EES: No ~ for % units. Usually 15%, not 15~%.  Or 15~%/yr.
- [ ] EES: irreversibilities for BXCC
- [ ] EES: check energy balances for the BCC
 -[ ] EES: Implement Q_loss into BXCC
- [ ] EES: Read the entire paper completely. Edit the nomenclature table.
- [ ] EES: Draft an abstract
- [ ] EES: Draft a conclusion
- [ ] EES: Figure out why iron ore processes have lower efficiency than
           limestone or coal processes

- [X] EES: Clean up all broken names in the name manager in Paper Examples.xlsx
- [X] Coke oven efficiencies should be lower 
- [X] Tidy up arrows 
- [X] MCC B RUVY nonzero energy balances
- [X] Name regions in MCC B RUVY R_B
- [X] Name regions in MCC m RUVY R_m
- [X] Add U_feed, U_EIOU matrices (same structure as **U**) for material and energy
- [X] Add r_EIOU matrix (ratio of EIOU to U, same structure as U, zero matrix)
- [X] Add S_units matrix (rows of energy carriers, same as rows of U matrix, column is units w/ entry as 1)
- [X] Add element balance to each process
- [X] b for fuels
- [X] h to [kJ/mol]
- [X] hM matrix
- [X] edit matrices
- [X] example appendix
- [X] Erin's laptop usable
- [x] fix warnings
- [x] Rotary kiln efficiencies should be higher
