- [ ] Tidy up arrows 
- [ ] MCC B RUVY nonzero energy balances
- [ ] Name regions in MCC B RUVY R_B
- [ ] Name regions in MCC m RUVY R_m
- [ ] Add U_feed, U_EIOU matrices (same structure as **U**) for material and energy
- [ ] Add r_EIOU matrix (ratio of EIOU to U, same structure as U, zero matrix)
- [ ] Add S_units matrix (rows of energy carriers, same as rows of U matrix, column is units w/ entry as 1)
